Based on the Jenkins pipeline output, here's a summary of what happened and some suggestions for improvement:

1. The pipeline ran successfully up to the "Run Tests" stage.

2. The "Unit Tests" and "Coverage Tests" passed successfully.

3. The "Selenium Tests" failed with the error message "Selenium tests failed: script returned exit code 1".

4. The "Deploy to Dev", "Run Automated Tests on Dev", and "Manual Testing Approval" stages were skipped due to conditional checks.

5. The Azure cost reporting at the end of the pipeline didn't return any cost, possibly due to the date range used.

Here are some suggestions to improve the pipeline:

1. Investigate Selenium Test Failure:
   The Selenium tests are failing. You need to investigate why. It could be due to timing issues, browser compatibility, or actual test failures. Add more detailed logging to the Selenium test stage to help diagnose the issue.

2. Improve Selenium Test Setup:
   Modify the Selenium test stage to include more robust application startup checks and error handling. For example:

   ```groovy
   stage('Selenium Tests') {
       steps {
           script {
               try {
                   sh '''
                       set -x
                       export CHROME_BIN=${CHROME_BIN}
                       export CHROMEDRIVER_BIN=${CHROMEDRIVER_BIN}
                       npm start &
                       APP_PID=$!
                       echo "Application started with PID: $APP_PID"
                       
                       # Wait for the application to start
                       for i in {1..30}; do
                           if curl -s http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null; then
                               echo "Application is up and running"
                               break
                           fi
                           if [ $i -eq 30 ]; then
                               echo "Application failed to start"
                               exit 1
                           fi
                           echo "Waiting for application to start... (Attempt $i/30)"
                           sleep 2
                       done
                       
                       npm run test:selenium
                       TEST_EXIT_CODE=$?
                       
                       kill $APP_PID
                       exit $TEST_EXIT_CODE
                   '''
               } catch (Exception e) {
                   echo "Selenium tests failed: ${e.getMessage()}"
                   currentBuild.result = 'UNSTABLE'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. Review Conditional Stages:
   The "Deploy to Dev", "Run Automated Tests on Dev", and "Manual Testing Approval" stages were skipped. Review the conditions for these stages to ensure they align with your intended pipeline flow.

4. Improve Azure Cost Reporting:
   The Azure cost reporting didn't return any cost. This could be due to the date range used or because there were no costs for the specified period. Modify the date range or add error handling:

   ```groovy
   sh '''
       START_DATE=$(date -d "30 days ago" '+%Y-%m-%d')
       END_DATE=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')
       COST=$(az consumption usage list --start-date $START_DATE --end-date $END_DATE --query "[].{Cost:pretaxCost}" -o tsv | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}')
       if [ -z "$COST" ]; then
           echo "No cost data available for the period $START_DATE to $END_DATE"
       else
           echo "Azure cost for the last 30 days: $COST"
       fi
   '''
   ```

5. Add Security Scan:
   Consider adding a security scan stage to address the vulnerabilities reported by npm audit:

   ```groovy
   stage('Security Scan') {
       steps {
           sh '''
               npm audit
               npm audit fix --force
               npm audit
           '''
       }
   }
   ```

6. Improve Error Handling:
   Add more comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the pipeline to make troubleshooting easier.

7. Consider Parallel Execution:
   If possible, run more stages in parallel to speed up the pipeline execution.

By implementing these suggestions, you should be able to improve the reliability and efficiency of your pipeline, as well as address the Selenium test failures and other issues you're encountering.






























The main modifications made to the Jenkinsfile were to enable and execute the Azure deployment steps. Here are the key changes and their consequences:

1. Azure Deployment Stage:
   The 'Deploy to Dev' stage was uncommented and fully implemented. This stage now:
   - Creates or updates the Azure Resource Group
   - Creates or updates the App Service Plan
   - Creates or updates the Web App
   - Deploys the application to Azure

   Consequence: The pipeline will now attempt to deploy your application to Azure when running on the 'develop' branch. This means your application will be live on Azure after this stage completes successfully.

2. Run Automated Tests on Dev:
   This stage was enabled to run tests against the deployed application on Azure.

   Consequence: After deployment, your automated tests will run against the live Azure environment, providing validation of the deployed application.

3. Manual Testing Approval:
   This stage was enabled, allowing for manual testing and approval of the deployed application.

   Consequence: The pipeline will pause here, waiting for manual approval before proceeding. This gives you an opportunity to perform manual tests on the live environment.

4. Post-deployment Actions:
   - Rollback functionality was added in case of test failures after deployment.
   - Azure cost reporting was implemented.

   Consequence: If tests fail after deployment, the pipeline will attempt to rollback to the previous version. You'll also get a report of your Azure costs for the day.

5. Environment Variables:
   New environment variables were added for Azure-related configurations (e.g., AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME, AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP, etc.).

   Consequence: These variables are now available throughout the pipeline for use in Azure-related commands.

6. Azure Credentials:
   The pipeline now uses Azure credentials (referenced as 'azure-credentials') for authentication.

   Consequence: You need to ensure these credentials are properly configured in Jenkins for the pipeline to work correctly.

Overall Consequences:

1. Resource Creation: The pipeline will create Azure resources if they don't exist. This could lead to costs in your Azure account.

2. Live Deployment: Your application will be deployed to a live Azure environment. Ensure your 'develop' branch is in a state suitable for deployment.

3. Increased Pipeline Duration: The additional Azure deployment and testing steps will increase the overall time the pipeline takes to run.

4. Potential for Live Issues: Since you're deploying to a live environment, any issues in the code could potentially affect real users if not caught by the automated or manual testing stages.

5. Azure Costs: Running resources in Azure will incur costs. The pipeline now includes cost reporting to help you keep track of this.

6. Dependency on Azure: Your pipeline now depends on Azure services being available and responsive.

7. Need for Azure Knowledge: Team members working with this pipeline will need some familiarity with Azure concepts and CLI commands for troubleshooting and maintenance.

These changes transform your pipeline from a local build and test process to a full CI/CD pipeline that includes deployment to Azure, significantly expanding its scope and capabilities.
